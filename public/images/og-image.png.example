This file is a placeholder for the Open Graph (OG) image.

In a real implementation, replace this with a JPG or PNG image file (recommended dimensions: 1200x630 pixels) that represents your portfolio and appears when your site is shared on social media.

*Design Tips:*
1. Include your name and profession prominently.
2. Use a clean, professional design.
3. Match the color palette of your portfolio.
4. Optimize the image for web use (compressed without significant quality loss).

Once you've created your image, rename this file to `og-image.jpg` or `og-image.png`, or replace it entirely. Ensure the path is correct in `layout.tsx`.
